Talk to a Wyckoff master in natural language. He commands 20 quantitative tools, chains multi-step reasoning, and tells you whether to strike.

Web + CLI + MCP triple channel, Gemini / Claude / OpenAI / DeepSeek multi-model switching, GitHub Actions for fully automated daily runs.

## Features

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Conversational Agent | Trigger diagnosis, screening, and reports in plain language; the LLM orchestrates 20 tools autonomously; also reads/writes files, executes commands, and fetches web pages |
| Five-Layer Funnel | Full market ~4 500 stocks -> ~30 candidates via six channels + sector resonance + micro triggers |
| AI Three-Camp Report | Logic Bankrupt / Reserve Camp / Springboard — LLM renders an independent verdict |
| Portfolio Diagnosis | Batch health check: MA structure, accumulation phase, trigger signals, stop-loss status |
| Private Rebalance | Synthesizes holdings + candidates, outputs EXIT / TRIM / HOLD / PROBE / ATTACK orders, pushes to Telegram |
| Tail-Buy Strategy | Executes at 13:50, two-stage evaluation (rule scoring + LLM review) for end-of-day entries |
| Signal Confirmation Pool | L4 trigger signals must pass 1-3 day price confirmation before becoming actionable |
| Recommendation Tracking | Historical picks auto-sync closing prices and compute cumulative returns |
| Daily-Bar Backtest | Replays post-funnel N-day returns; reports win rate / Sharpe / max drawdown |
| Pre-Market Risk | A50 futures + VIX monitoring with four alert levels |
| Local Dashboard | `wyckoff dashboard` — recommendations, signals, portfolio, agent memory, chat logs; dark/light theme, bilingual CN/EN |
| Agent Memory | Cross-session memory: auto-extracts session conclusions, injects relevant context on next query; preference memory never expires |
| Context Compaction | Dynamic threshold (25% of model context window) auto-compresses long conversations, smart tool result summarization preserves key data |
| Tool Confirmation | `exec_command`, `write_file`, `update_portfolio` require user approval before execution |
| General Agent Capabilities | Execute commands, read/write files, fetch web pages — send a CSV path and it will analyze it |
| MCP Server | 15 tools exposed via MCP protocol — plug into Claude Code / Cursor / any MCP client |
| Multi-Channel Notifications | Feishu / WeCom / DingTalk / Telegram |

## Data Sources

Daily bar auto-fallback chain:

```
tickflow → tushare → akshare → baostock → efinance
```

When any source is unavailable the system silently falls back to the next — zero intervention required.

> **Recommended: connect TickFlow for stronger real-time / intraday capabilities**
> Register: [TickFlow Registration](https://tickflow.org/auth/register?ref=5N4NKTCPL4)

## Quick Start

### One-line Install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoungCan-Wang/Wyckoff-Analysis/main/install.sh | bash
```

Detects Python, installs uv, creates an isolated environment. Run `wyckoff` when done.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap YoungCan-Wang/wyckoff
brew install wyckoff
```

### pip

```bash
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install youngcan-wyckoff-analysis
wyckoff
```

Once inside:
- `/model` — choose a model (Gemini / Claude / OpenAI) and enter your API key
- `/login` — sign in to sync cloud portfolio
- Start asking questions

```
> Compare 000001 and 600519 — which one is the better buy?
> Judge my portfolio
> What's the market temperature right now?
```

Upgrade: `wyckoff update`

### Backtest Grid

18 parameter combos run in parallel, outputs optimal parameters, Sharpe matrix, and strategy health check:

| Optimal Params & Ranking | Parameter Matrix |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="../attach/backtest-grid-1.png" width="450" /> | <img src="../attach/backtest-grid-2.png" width="450" /> |

### Web

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoungCan-Wang/Wyckoff-Analysis.git
cd Wyckoff-Analysis
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 20 Tools

The agent's arsenal — 15 quant tools + 5 general capabilities:

| Tool | Capability |
|---|---|
| `search_stock_by_name` | Fuzzy search by name, ticker, or pinyin |
| `diagnose_stock` | Structured Wyckoff diagnosis for a single stock |
| `get_portfolio` | View holdings + available cash |
| `diagnose_portfolio` | Batch portfolio health scan |
| `update_portfolio` | Add / modify / delete holdings, set available cash |
| `get_stock_price` | Recent OHLCV quotes |
| `get_market_overview` | Broad market temperature overview |
| `screen_stocks` | Five-layer funnel full-market screening (⚡background) |
| `generate_ai_report` | Three-camp AI deep research report (⚡background) |
| `generate_strategy_decision` | Hold/exit existing positions + new buy decisions (⚡background) |
| `get_recommendation_tracking` | Historical recommendations and follow-up performance |
| `get_signal_pending` | Query the signal confirmation pool |
| `get_tail_buy_history` | Tail-buy strategy historical results |
| `run_backtest` | Funnel strategy historical backtest (⚡background) |
| `delete_tracking_records` | Delete recommendation / signal records |
| `check_background_tasks` | Background task progress query |
| `exec_command` | Execute local shell commands |
| `read_file` | Read local files (CSV/Excel auto-parsed) |
| `write_file` | Write files (export reports/data) |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch web content (financial news/announcements) |

Tool call order and frequency are decided by the LLM at runtime — no pre-choreography needed. Send a CSV path and it reads it; say "install a package" and it executes.

## Five-Layer Funnel

| Layer | Name | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Garbage Filter | Remove ST / BSE / STAR Market; market cap >= 3.5 B CNY; avg daily turnover >= 50 M CNY |
| L2 | Six-Channel Selection | Rally / Ignition / Stealth / Accumulation / Dry Volume / Support |
| L3 | Sector Resonance | Top-N industry distribution filter |
| L4 | Micro Triggers | Spring / LPS / SOS / EVR — four trigger signals |
| L5 | AI Verdict | LLM three-camp classification: Logic Bankrupt / Reserve / Springboard |

## Daily Automation

Built-in GitHub Actions cron jobs:

| Task | Schedule (Beijing Time) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Funnel + AI Report + Rebalance | Sun–Thu 18:25 | Fully automated; results pushed to Feishu / Telegram |
| Tail-Buy Strategy | Mon–Fri 13:50 | Rule scoring + LLM review, end-of-day entry screening |

## Model Support

**CLI**: Gemini / Claude / OpenAI — switch with `/model`; any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, etc.).

**Web / Pipeline**: Gemini / OpenAI / DeepSeek / Qwen / Kimi / Zhipu / Volcengine / Minimax — 8 providers total.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Minimum required:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` | Auth and cloud sync |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or another provider's key) | Powers the LLM |

Optional: `TICKFLOW_API_KEY` (TickFlow real-time/intraday, primary data chain), `TUSHARE_TOKEN` (premium data fallback), `FEISHU_WEBHOOK_URL` (Feishu push), `TG_BOT_TOKEN` + `TG_CHAT_ID` (Telegram push).

See the [Architecture doc](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full config reference and GitHub Actions Secrets setup.

## MCP Server

Expose Wyckoff analysis capabilities via the [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling Claude Code / Cursor / any MCP client to call 15 tools directly.

```bash
# Install MCP dependency
uv pip install youngcan-wyckoff-analysis[mcp]

# Register with Claude Code
claude mcp add wyckoff -- wyckoff-mcp
```

Or add manually in your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wyckoff": {
      "command": "wyckoff-mcp",
      "env": {
        "TUSHARE_TOKEN": "your_token",
        "TICKFLOW_API_KEY": "your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once registered, just ask "diagnose 000001" in Claude Code / Cursor to invoke Wyckoff tools.

## Wyckoff Skills

Lightweight reuse of the Wyckoff analysis capability: [`YoungCan-Wang/wyckoff_skill`](https://github.com/YoungCan-Wang/wyckoff_skill.git)

Ideal for giving any AI assistant a quick "Wyckoff lens."
